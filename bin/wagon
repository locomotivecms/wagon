# Rbenv shims and the bundler/inline feature don't work quite well, at least in Ruby 2.5.0.
#
# The reasons is that Wagon rbenv shim activates all the gems of the Wagon gem.
# When activating them, it might load versions of the gems different from
# the ones specified by the gemfile statement.
#
# Hopefully, it just activates meaning it doesn't load them.
# So the solution is simple: reset both the Gem loaded specs and the $LOAD_PATH variable.
