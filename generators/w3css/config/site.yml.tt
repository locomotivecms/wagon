# Each site can have its own set of custom properties organized in namespaces.
# First, define namespaces and their fields in the config/metafields_schema.yml file.
# Finally, set default values below as described in the example.
# You can access them in your liquid templates and snippets:
#   {{ site.metafields.<namespace>.<field> }}
#
# Example:
#
# metafields:
#   shop:
#     address: 700 South Laflin Street
